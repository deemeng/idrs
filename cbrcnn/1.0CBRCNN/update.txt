compare to 0.0CBRCNN updates:

1. model name
    CBRCNNStage1
    CBRCNNStage2
    
2. hyperparams
    - num_layers (num_of_hidden_layers for LSTM) = 1
    - hidden_size = 40 [reduced to 20 for Stage 2]
    - conv1D (num_of_channel = 1)
    - batch_size = 1 or 16

3. Model Structure
    For each stage:
    - one BiLSTM layer (1 hidden layer -- num_layers=1)
    - one Conv2d layer: input_channel=1, output_channel=3, kernel_szie = (7, hidden_size*2)
    - tanh activation function
    - one Conv1d layer: input_channel=3, output_channel=1, kernel_szie = 1
    - sigmoid output
    
4. 2 Models: modelStage1 & modelStage2
    - save 2 models seperactly each time
    - plot for 2 models as well

5. Functions
    - seqSegment
        Add a util function seqSegment to process the output from Stage1 as the input of Stage 2.
